# SQL_covid_project
Project showing some SQL skills

Dataset was obtained from: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths
Afterwards, the dataset was divided in two tables for the mere porpuse of show casing **joints**, **Temp Tables**, **windows functions**. As you will see in the queries, I also implemented aggregate functions, converting data types, etc. 

This project was implemented in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.
